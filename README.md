#### inside the model
#### Refer codes and dataset

## 3.SALES PREDICTIONS
#### Similar to the email once but here we are using different model so called LinearRegression
#### Output is display via graphs for better understandings
#### Refer codes and dataset for better understandings

### The codes are in subfiles including the dataset
